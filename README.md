# Talk: Building libraries for iOS — Going native

As the iOS community grows, code sharing becomes more and more important thing to discuss. In this presentation I'll share my experience of being a library vendor. I'll give an overview of dependency management approaches. In the "Going Native" part I'll explain why it might be a good idea to stay native and master your libraries manually.

**Remarks : ** One more thing… We are going to talk a bit about mixing Objective-C and C++.
